phpdoc-md is a tool to generate nicely looking documentation from PHPDOC comments.
The intention of this tool is little bit different then standard PHPDocumentator.
It focus on class instances and generates documentation from public methods only.
Whenever class inherits from some other class the full interface from parent and child will be presented
as part of it. 

phpdoc-md is configured via single `.phpdoc-md` file located in project root directory.

Example of `.phpdoc-md` file:

```
<?php
return (object)[
    'rootNamespace' => 'Clean\PhpDocMd\Example',
    'destDirectory' => 'docs',
    'format' => 'github',
    'classes' => [
        '\Clean\PhpDocMd\Example\Basic' => [],
        '\Clean\PhpDocMd\Example\Deep\Foo' => [],
            'excludeParentMethods' => false,
        ],
        '\Clean\PhpDocMd\Example\ExtendClass' => [
            'excludeParentMethods' => true,
        ],
        '\Clean\PhpDocMd\Example\ExtendExtendClass' => [
            'excludeParentMethods' => true,
        ],
    ],
];
```

You can see an example documentation generated by this tool in [here](docs/README.md)
